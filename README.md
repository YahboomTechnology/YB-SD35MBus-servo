# Introduction
35kg serial bus servo is a high-performance steering gear control device, it is designed to meet the needs of complex mechanical motion. The rotation range is 0~270Â°, with a power output shaft and an auxiliary fixed shaft. Built-in high-precision potentiometers, stainless steel gears and bearings, not only ensures the accuracy of position control, but also increases the durability of the servo. There are three HY2.0-3Pin interfaces on it, users can complete wiring from multiple angles, and with the help of serial bus communication technology, multiple servos can be controlled on the same bus at the same time. Connect it to computer by Yaboom drive board, users can adjust angle of servo in real time through the PC software, achieve more precise control in projects such as robotic arms and bionic robots.
# Features
* Intelligent serial bus communication: Using serial bus communication technology, it simplifies wiring and supports multiple servos to work on the same bus to achieve coordinated motion control.
* Excellent torque performance: 35kg torque output, coupled with the power output shaft and auxiliary fixed shaft, ensure that your mechanical device can cope with various complex tasks.
* Precise position control: High-resolution encoder and algorithm, which canrealize high-precision position control.
* Durable structure: The high qualityouter case and internal parts ensure the long-term and stable use of the servo.
* Wide range of applications: It can be used on robotic arms, automation systems,bionic robots and so on.
